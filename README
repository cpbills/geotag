this script is a few years old, born of necessity, even though there are
likely dozens if not hundreds of time + image + coords pairing programs and
scripts out there now.

the existing (free) windows based program had a really cool concept of
locating the nearest city/feature name and using that in the tags.

unfortunately, it would wipe all other exif tags from the image, and that
was not good... so i wrote this.

still not extremely user friendly, mostly meant for myself and portfolio...
but if you're a tinkerer, feel free to fork it and play around... i'm
interested in any constructive feedback...

features:
- config file. yay, you can set all sorts of options!
- configurable for down-to-the-second accuracy, depending on the
  frequency your GPSr records your location
- queries geonames.org and google maps for geocoding information
- injects all sorts of information into your exif tags...
- generates a nice description for flickr (not so true for picasa...)
