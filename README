this script is a few years old, born of necessity, even though there are
likely dozens if not hundreds of time + image + coords pairing programs and
scripts out there now.

the existing (free) windows based program had a really cool concept of
locating the nearest city/feature name and using that in the tags.

unfortunately, it would wipe all other exif tags from the image, and that
was not good... so i wrote this.

features:
seconds offset definable in code (config file coming?)
timezone / gmt offset configurable
finds nearest city/location and adds exif info
takes other exif info, and creates tags for it (lens, camera, etc)

possibly more, it's been a long while since i touched this code... i'll be
lucky if the place-name lookup still functions...
